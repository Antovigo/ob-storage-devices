If you use the Openbox window manager, you might wish for a way to quickly mount, open or unmount your storage devices (usb sticks, SD cards…). This « Pipe menu » intends to solve this problem.

For further information about Openbox's pipe menus, especially about how to install them, check this link:
http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Pipemenus

You can filter out the devices you don't want to see (like /dev/sda* and /dev/sr0) by editing the code. Also, I use Thunar as my file manager, replace it accordingly if you use another one.

For maximum fun, put the content.png image inside the ~/.config/openbox/ directory.
